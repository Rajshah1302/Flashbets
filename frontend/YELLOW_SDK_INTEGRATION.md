## Configuration

### Yellow Network Settings
The application is configured to use the Yellow Network testnet:

```typescript
export const YELLOW_CONFIG = {
  CLEARNODE_WS_URL: 'wss://clearnet-sandbox.yellow.com/ws',
  FAUCET_URL: 'https://clearnet-sandbox.yellow.com/faucet/requestTokens',
  TEST_TOKEN_SYMBOL: 'YELLOW_TEST_USD',
};
```

### Supported Chains
- Sepolia (Ethereum testnet)
- Base Sepolia
- Arbitrum Sepolia

## Testing

### Testnet Features
- **Faucet Integration**: Request free test tokens
- **Simulated Trading**: Execute trades without real funds
- **Balance Management**: Track unified balance across chains
- **Trade History**: View recent trading activity

### Getting Test Tokens
Use the built-in faucet integration:
```bash
curl -XPOST https://clearnet-sandbox.yellow.com/faucet/requestTokens \
  -d '{"userAddress":"<your_address>"}'
```

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Always validate user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Use production Clearnode URLs
- Add rate limiting for trade execution

### Performance
- Implement connection pooling
- Add caching for balance queries
- Optimize real-time updates
- Handle network disconnections

### Monitoring
- Track trade success rates
- Monitor balance changes
- Log error conditions
- Implement alerting

## Next Steps

### For Production
1. **Upgrade to Production Clearnode**: Replace testnet URLs with production endpoints
2. **Implement Real Contract Integration**: Connect to actual prediction market contracts
3. **Add Advanced Features**: Multi-asset trading, complex order types
4. **Enhance Security**: Add additional validation and error handling

### For Development
1. **Add More Test Cases**: Comprehensive testing for all trading scenarios
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Better user feedback for various error conditions
3. **Add Analytics**: Track user behavior and trading patterns
4. **Optimize Performance**: Reduce latency and improve responsiveness
